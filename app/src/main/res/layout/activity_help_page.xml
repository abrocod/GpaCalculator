\n
GPA Calculation:\n
\n
Herec you can calculate your overall GPA based on a certain point scale.\n
Your Grade is a Grade out of 1-100, and your GPA weight is the amount of credits your course is worth - for example, 0.5 or 1.0 credits.\n
\n
Final Grade Calculation:\n
\n
Here, you can calculate your final grade standing in a course.\n
Your Grade is a Grade, again, a number from 1-100, and your Course Weight is the percentage amount of that mark towards your overall grade - 
for example, an assignment worth 30% of your grade. This is also a number from 1-100.\n
\n
As you add grades (the app currently supports calculation of up to 10 grades), you can scroll through to get access to all of the grades.\n
\n
I hope you enjoy this application!\n
